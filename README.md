## PartyBid
PartyBid is a protocol that allows a group of internet homies to pool their funds together in order to win an NFT auction.

## PartyDAO ðŸ¥³
PartyBid is the first product developed by PartyDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that builds and ships products. PartyDAO was [created initially](https://d.mirror.xyz/FLqkPA3iN4x-p97UhfhWwaCx8rBmVo-1yttY20oaob4) for the purpose of shipping PartyBid.
To keep up with PartyDAO, follow [@prtyDAO](https://twitter.com/prtyDAO) on Twitter and [Mirror](https://party.mirror.xyz/). Acquire 10 [$PARTY tokens](https://etherscan.io/token/0x402eb84d9cb2d6cf66bde9b46d7277d3f4a16b54?a=0x2f4bea4cb44d0956ce4980e76a20a8928e00399a) to join the DAO and party with us.

## Features
- A PartyBid contract is deployed targeting a single NFT auction
- Anyone can contribute ETH to the PartyBid while the auction is still live
- Anyone who has contributed to the PartyBid can trigger a bid on the targeted NFT auction
- After the auction closes, if the PartyBid won the NFT, the token is fractionalized; all contributors whose funds were used to win the auction are rewarded with ERC-20 tokens representing a fractionalized share of the NFT. Tokens are fractionalized using [fractional.art contracts](https://github.com/fractional-company/contracts)
- If a PartyBid wins the NFT, a 5% fee is paid to the PartyDAO multisig 

## Functions
### PartyBidFactory
- `startParty` - deploy a PartyBid contract, specifying the NFT auction to target
### PartyBid 
- `contribute` - contribute ETH to the PartyBid
- `bid` - trigger a bid on the NFT auction. Always submits the minimum possible bid to beat the current high bidder. Reverts if the PartyBid is already the high bidder. 
  `finalize` - call once after the auction closes to record and finalize the results of the auction. Deploys the fractionalized NFT vault if the PartyBid won.
- `claim` - call once per contributor after the auction closes to claim fractionalized ERC-20 tokens (for any funds that were used to win the auction) and/or excess ETH (if the auction was lost, or if the funds were not used to win the auction)
- `recover` - callable by the PartyDAO multisig to withdraw the NFT if (and only if) the auction was incorrectly marked as Lost

## Deployed Addresses
You can find the address of deployed PartyBid Factories on each chain at `deploy/deployed-contracts`

## Repo Layout
- `contracts/PartyBid.sol` - core logic contract for PartyBid
- `contracts/PartyBidFactory.sol` - factory contract used to deploy new PartyBid instances in a gas-efficient manner
- `contracts/market-wrapper` - MarketWrapper contracts enable PartyBid to integrate with different NFT auction implementations using a common interface
- `deploy` - Deployment script for contracts
- `test` - Hardhat tests for the core protocol
- `contracts/external` - External protocols' contracts ([Fractional Art](https://github.com/fractional-company/contracts), [Zora Auction House](https://github.com/ourzora/auction-house), [Foundation Market](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa7d94560dbd814af316dd96fde78b9136a977d1c#code)), copied to this repo for use in integration testing.
- `contracts/test` - Contracts written for use in testing

## Installation
1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

2. Setup your `.env` file in order to deploy the contracts
```bash
touch .env && cat .env.example > .env
```
Then, populate the values in `.env`.

## Tests
To run the Hardhat tests, simply run
```bash
npm run test
```

## Deployment
To deploy a new PartyBid Factory, first ensure you've populated your `.env` file. The RPC endpoint should point chain you want to deploy the contracts, and the private key of the Deployer account should be funded with ETH on that chain .

Next, add a config file to `deploy/configs/[CHAIN_NAME].json` specifying the addresses of the necessary external protocols on that chain. You can use other files in that folder to see which contract addresses must be populated.

Finally, run
```bash
npm run deploy
```
